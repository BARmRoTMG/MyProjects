      comment: "I can only say that my last trip to VANUATU has regained my faith in human nature and that the country is made of better and kinder people than the rest of the world. I was treated so well and by so many people that I pray I go back soon. From free breakfasts at the COFFEE TREE CAFE to a free night at the BLUE PANGO Pango road. These people know how to treat travelers in need. God bless them."

He was so knowledgeable and professional we decided to spend a day touring with him in Tel Aviv before our flight back. It was so fun, he went out of his way to find a restaurant that would seat us last minute on Valentines day( not easy) but he found us a great restaurant! Had fun seeing Old Jaffa, local markets and hearing the history of Tel Aviv. He was courteous, realized I was getting too tired to he grabbed I would definitely use him again."

      comment: "Behind every corner, Avi spoils you with a secret hidden gem you would never have found if you were touring by yourself. My favourite was the Druze coffee overlooking Carmel Mountain. My girlfriend and I have toured the holy land 3 times with Avi and each time we are left craving for more. Avi has guided us around Jerusalem, the Dead Sea, Masada, wineries, even a dairy farm and not forgetting the vibey Tel Aviv scene. Avi tailored our tours perfectly to our needs. We loved the coffee and Avi's special hummus sandwiches he provided us with :) Our journeys were filled with laughter and fun. Can't wait for next time Avi!"

      comment: "We had an amazing trip thanks to Avi. He was very aware of our limited time and managed to curate a trip for us that allowed us to experience more in the day we had then in probably any other trip I have ever taken. Jerusalem is simply one of the most impressive and inspirational places I have I ever traveled to and having a caring expert like Avi to guide you on your way ensures that you can experience all it has to offer. I can highly recommend his services, as we already have done for friends and family who all have similarly had great experiences."

He has arranged for a pickup from our hotel and drove us to Jerusalem... Along the way we stopped at the mount of olives and then we went to the old town of Jerusalem... we walked through the market and we then visited the old town, the western wall and the Church of the Resurrection....after the day ended avi was very kind to answer any other questions we had regarding TelAviv and shared some tips. Finally we booked Avi for our trip to the airport. For sure if we go back to TelAviv we will contact him to arrange the trip to the dead sea, which we didnâ€™t have the time to do...."
